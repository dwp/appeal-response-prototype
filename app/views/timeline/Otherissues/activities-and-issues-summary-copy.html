                  The Work Capability Assessment is a test of a person's ability to perform everyday activities and functions. The questions are designed to be relevant to that purpose. <br> <br>

The report is not a detailed record of the assessment but a statement of a person's ability to work. It reflects the Health Care Professional's opinion of the appellant's functional ability after they have considered all available evidence. <br> <br>

The Work Capability Assessment was completed by a Health Care Professional approved by the Secretary of State of Work and Pensions. They were fully aware of the appellant's medical conditions and how they affect them. <br> <br>

We are satisfied with the accuracy and integrity of their report. <br> <br>

The report contains detailed medical, social and occupational histories. It contains the appellant's own account of their typical day, And it contains the mental state examination results and the Health Care Professionals own observations. <br> <br>

We are satisfied that all of the appellant's medical conditions have been taken into account when reaching our decision.
