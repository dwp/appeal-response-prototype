Entitlement to PIP is not the same as having limited capability for work. It is a different benefit with different purposes and different assessment criteria.<br><br> 

In this appeal, we can consider the medical evidence which was used to decide PIP entitlement, but not the entitlement itself.<br><br> 

As part of their PIP assessment, the appellant may have shown that they need to use an aid to complete daily activities or to move around.<br><br> 

Because the use of such aids would be reasonable in the modern workplace, and because the appellant could then complete the activity on a reliable and repeated basis, the Work Capability Assessment would not consider this to indicate limited capability for work. <br><br>
